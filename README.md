# password_generator
# This code generates an eight-character password which consists of at least one number, one lowercase letter and one uppercase letters.
# It asks if the user wants to get a password, and if the answer is 'yes' (the user enters '1'), it gives a random password.
# The user can exit the code anytime by entering '0'.
